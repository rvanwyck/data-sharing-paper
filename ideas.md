We have been invited to contribute to a special section of Ideas in Ecology and Evolution on Data Sharing.

> Forthcoming Special Issue: Data sharing in Ecology and Evolution.
> This issue, edited by Karthik Ram, will explore the changing attitudes towards data sharing in ecology and evolution,
> and the implications of rapid data sharing on the impact of research, reproducibility,
> and potential for fostering novel synthesis.

My currently poorly formed idea for this paper is to talk about the importance of thinking about data users,
as well as data providers in the discussions, culture, and approaches of data sharing.
In my experience we spend a lot of time thinking about making it easy for folks to make data quickly and easily available,
which is absolutely great, but not a lot of time thinking about making it quick and easy for folks to use the data.
There are some inherent tradeoffs here and my thought was that a discussion of those tradeoffs and the value and approach
of making that data not only open, but useable,
would provide some value to the community by helping to maximize what is made with the data that is shared.

This could be captured in something like "Ten simple things you can do to make it easy to reuse your data"
